# InteractivitySample

This project is demonstrating to shape the behavior of a dependency by letting the user select an option interactively. The dependency here is the algorithm. The algorithm can sometimes ask the user how to proceed by using an `IInteractiveChooser` interface. If so, the user might interactively shape the behavior of the algorithm based on the option he/she selects.
